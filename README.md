## Description

ICouch is a CouchDB client for Elixir using [ibrowse][ibrowse]
for HTTP transfer.

JSON encoding/decoding is provided by [Jason][jason].

ICouch claims to be more "Elixir Style" than other implementations based on
couchbeam and offers a more rigid changes follower tested against vanilla
CouchDB and Cloudant. That said, many calls might look and behave similarly
like couchbeam's since the intent is often the same. However, parameter order
and types will differ in most cases; most notably maps are used instead of
JSON keyword lists.

Another innovation is, that documents are represented as Elixir structs. These
offer a way to conveniently manage attachments in binary form and also implement
the Access behavior and Enumerable protocol for easy handling of a document's
fields.

## Status

This project is currently in beta phase.

ToDo's:
* Implement view streaming
* Implement one-shot changes streaming
* Finish documentation
* Write more tests

## Installation

Add ICouch to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:
